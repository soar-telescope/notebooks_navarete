Jupyter Notebooks for SOAR data processing and analysis. by F. Navarete

1. Exposure Time Calculator for TripleSpec ([ETC_TripleSpec.ipynb](https://github.com/soar-telescope/notebooks_navarete/blob/main/ETC_TripleSpec.ipynb)) <br>
The ETC is currently based on ARCOIris data, so it might be accurate in 20%.
We are working to update it with the actual TripleSpec configuration.
